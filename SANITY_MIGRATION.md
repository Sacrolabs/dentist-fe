## üîß How to Use

npx tsx scripts/seed-team.ts
npx tsx scripts/seed-testimonials.ts
npx tsx scripts/seed-hero-settings.ts
```

## üìù Environment Variables Required

In `.env.local`:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=xjbiwocx
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET=production
SANITY_API_VERSION=2025-10-13
SANITY_API_TOKEN=<your_write_token>  # Only needed for seeding
```

## üé® CSS Fix Applied

Fixed CSS conflicts between Sanity Studio and main site:
- Added `styled-components` compiler to Next.js config
- Created isolated layout for Studio route
- Studio now renders independently without affecting main site styles

## üöÄ Next Steps (Optional)

### Not Yet Migrated (Still Hardcoded)
- `components/hero.tsx` - Hero section on homepage
- `components/services.tsx` - Services preview on homepage
- `components/testimonials.tsx` - Testimonials section on homepage
- `components/footer.tsx` - Footer content

These can be migrated later by:
1. Creating server component versions
2. Fetching from Sanity using existing queries
3. Updating page imports

### Preview/Draft Mode
- Can add Next.js Draft Mode for content preview before publishing
- Requires adding preview routes and token handling
