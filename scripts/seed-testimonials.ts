He explained everything step by stepâ€”and kept me in the loop the whole time. He gave me a definitive quotation and stuck to his quote - no surprises.\n What I really liked? He didn\'t try to sell me a bunch of random stuff I didn\'t need. No nonsense here. Just straight-up honest advice and solid work.\n Prices were fair, and the whole vibe was super friendly.\n He is a gem of person and being under his care for 4 months, I\'ve come to trust him with my teeth from now on.\n If you need a dentist who knows what they\'re doing and keeps it real, Dr. Lakshay is your guy. If you are planning to do a Dental Implant, definitely get a consultation here before you make the final call. I found them to be reasonably priced compared to others.\n Highly recommendâ€”my new tooth and I are very happy!',
